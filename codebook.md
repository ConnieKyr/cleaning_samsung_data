## CODEBOOK FOR THE SAMSUNG DATA CLEANING PROJECT

*Dataset that was analysed:*
The *Samsung data*, coming from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 were downloaded from the following 
repository:

The data contains measurements from experiments with 30 volunteers wearing smartphones that were recorded while the volunteers were doing certain
activities. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the authors
captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments had been video-recorded to label the data manually.
The obtained dataset was then randomly partitioned into two sets,
where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
Each record of the train and test dataset contained:
All the measurements encoded as features, normalized and bounded within [-1,1]
 Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.......

The measurements contained were:

*Variables used*
